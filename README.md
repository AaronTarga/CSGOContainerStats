# CSGOContainerStats

This Python script parses the steam inventory history for unboxed csgo items from containers like cases, souvenir, packages,sticker capsules and so on.
If the script doesn't crash or get's stopped, it writes all unboxed items grouped by container where they got unboxed from into a file called stats.txt.

## Requirements

- A steam account with inventory history of csgo items  
- At least Python version 3.6 installed. The newest Python version at the official Python's [site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Python needs to have pip module installed, see [website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) of pip module for installation.

After you have Python and pip installed you can install all needed dependencies with this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Check that all requirements are fulfilled
2. Retrieve steam cookie
3. Enter cookie in example_profile.yaml file(see [example file](example_profile.yaml))
4. Rename example_profile.yaml to profile.yaml
4. Execute python script and wait for it to finish 
5. Stats are now written in stats.txt file from the directory where you executed the script

You can add --json or -j to the script to get a json output.

Script crashes with following message: "Couldn't fetch pages possibly to steam network error.".

**Tl;dr: Try to start the script again!**

What probably happened:
- Steam blocked your IP. This is unlikely to happen because the script only sends a few requests each minute.
- Your Cookie expired. If you restart the script it should detect the expired cookies and display a message that informs you to fetch new cookies.
- There was some sort of network error like the message says. In this case you should try to start the script again.
